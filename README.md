ThreeJS tennis ball trajectory simulation

This project aims to mimic the Hawkeye system used in tennis to check the landing of the ball. The user can simulate a tennis shot by input a list of parameters into the UI and clicking on Simulate Trajectory. By using basic projectile formulas, the path of the ball will be calculated from the moment of contact until it lands on the court.
